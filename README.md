Simple addon to use Chat GPT in the blender text editor for generating scripts.

Download the python file and install it to use the addon. Then go to [Open AI](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an account. Click on your profile picture and go to View API Keys. You may need to add a payment method if you don't have any free credits. The new Chat GPT endpoint is very affordable, you can view the pricing on the website. You should also set a limit so you don't accidentally spend more than you want.
